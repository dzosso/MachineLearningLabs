%% GAUSSian FIT
%   Assuming data was sampled from a Gaussian distribution, returns the most
%  likely parameters for the underlying distribution.
% Input:
%   X - A D-by-N matrix with observation locations in each column (thus the
%   	observations are in D-dimensions and there are N of them).
% Output:
%   mu - D-by-1 vector indicating the center of the Gaussian distribution.
%   sigma - Scalar indicating the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution.

function [mu, sigma] = gaussfit(X)
