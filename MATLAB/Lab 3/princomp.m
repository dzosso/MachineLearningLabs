% PRINcipal COMPonent calculator
%   Calculates the principal components of a collection of points.
% Input:
%   X - D-by-N data matrix of N points in D dimensions.
% Output:
%   W - A D-by-M matrix containing the M principal components of the data.
%   Z - A M-by-N matrix containing the latent variables of the data.
%   mu - A D-by-1 vector containing the mean of the data.
%   lambda - A vector containing the eigenvalues associated with the above principal components.

function [W, Z, mu, lambda] = princomp(X,M)
