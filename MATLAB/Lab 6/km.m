%% K-Means
%  Separate data points into K clusters with no other information.
% Inputs:
%  X - D-by-N matrix of N points in D dimensions.
%  K - Integer number of clusters to detect. 
% Outputs:
%  mu - D-by-K matrix with the learned cluster centroids.
%  labels - Length N vector with integer (1, 2, ..., K) class assignments.

function [mu, labels] = km(X, K)
