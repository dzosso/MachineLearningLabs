%% adaBOOST model LEARNer
%  Uses the AdaBoost algorithm to train a classifier on data.
% Inputs 
%  X - N x D : Observations
%  t - N x 1 : class labels
%  M - The number of weak learners to include in the ensemble.
% Outputs
%  params - A matrix containing the parameters for the M weak learners.
%  alpha - A vector of weights used to combine the results of the
%    M weak learners.

function [params, alpha] = boostlearn(X, t, M)
